# portablepotentiostat
This is the repository for the portable potentiostat published by our research group (https://scienceweb.clemson.edu/uacl/). Here you will find information regarding the firmware, hardware, graphical user interface as well as assemble instructions. More details regarding the instrumental characterization and analytical performance can be found in this paper.

Firmware: We have two versions of firmware available: firmware1_0 and firmwareUSB. Both versions can be uploded to ESP 32 microcontroller by using the Arduino IDE or by any other method of your preference (e.g. LUA, micropython, espress IDF and etc). If you are not familiar uploading code to ESP 32 by Arduino IDE, we recommend the following article: https://randomnerdtutorials.com/getting-started-with-esp32/.
